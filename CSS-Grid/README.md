I've learned CSS grid from different online resources However, I used Kevin Powell's giude for my example.
- grid is a two-dimensional css layout system.
One of the interesting thing I learned is 'grid-area' property, by setting a name to this property for an item you can set the grid based on your desire in next step. In another word, if you assign a name to the item in future by refrencing this name you can specified you own grid template by using another property named 'grid-template-areas' so you repeat the name of a grid area you already created. You can clone this exmaple and discover this cool feature.
