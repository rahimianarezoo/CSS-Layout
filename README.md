# CSS-Layout
I've learned CSS grid from different online resources However, I used Kevin Powell's giude for testimonial example.
- grid is a two-dimensional css layout system.
One of the interesting thing I learned is 'grid-area' property, by setting a name to this property for an item you can set the grid based on your desire in next step. In another word, if you assign a name to the item in future by refrencing this name you can specified you own grid template by using another property named 'grid-template-areas' so you repeat the name of a grid area you already created. You can clone this exmaple and discover this cool feature.

NOTE: When using 'grid-template-areas' make sure for each row you need to have the same number of cells.


NOTE: If you need an empty cell you can use a period "." which signifies an empty grid cell.
In Grid folder:
- I've worked with 'grid-areas' property which is a cool feature. 
- I've worked with 'grid-auto-column' property and help in situation of create any automatic generated column and it give the same size of each of them (I found it a nice feature)
